# Minimalistic-Arcade-Games
Minimalistic Arcade Games in Python


FOR TESTING:

    The programm should be executed from the parent of the Minimalistic-Arcade-Games directory.
    
    Please consider that we used COM3 port, change it if needed.
    
    Command: python -m Minimalistic-Arcade-Games.menu_all.menu_all

    For a certain game python3 Minimalistic-Arcade-Games/game_directory/game_menu.py

    The main menu and the menu of each game can be accessed via joystick. To select a certain 
    option, please press enter. For the rest of the game you will only use the joystick. (The button
    of the joystick was too sensitive to be used for accessing options).
